# Web-Application-Frameworks
This is one of the course in my masters(CSCI 680-K9).We used various frameworks to build simple applications.Gained some practical experience 
over some frameworks like PHP Laravel,Spring Boot,Django,Express,Angular JS ,Asp.net etc.
This course helped a lot to learn different frameworks.Worked effectively on building simple applications .I Really enjoyed doing this course.
